|-> Game objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NiKate is a simple MMORPG game written
in Java. The objetive is to get 15
experience points.

Each point is obtains by being over
another player (in the same position).
This will give you one point.

Furthermore, each player has Health
Points. You can lost them when another
player attack you. When you attack,
it will appear some fire near to you,
if the fire hit another player it
will lost 4 HP. Here is a figure of
the fire position.

X -> Player hit by the fire.
O -> Our player
# -> Normal position

X  #  X
#  O  #
X  #  X

The attack will take 1 second.

There are 4 maps. Each of them can
host 8 players at the same time.
The server will decide the map of each
player when they log in the service.
The assignment will be incremental,
starting by the map 0. Moreover, it
avoid assigning a map where there is a
user with the same ID (anti-spoofing).
